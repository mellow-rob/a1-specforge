# Phase 4: Audit

Spawn `a1-adam-auditor` to validate the PLAN.md before execution.

## Prompt template

```
Audit this PLAN.md for quality and coverage gaps. Write AUDIT.md.

<files_to_read>
- .a1/phases/<phase_name>/PLAN.md
- .a1/phases/<phase_name>/RESEARCH.md
- .a1/phases/<phase_name>/MAP.md
- <spec_path> (if provided)
</files_to_read>

**Output path:** .a1/phases/<phase_name>/AUDIT.md
```

## Completion and routing

### If verdict is PASS
- Inform user: "Plan ready. No blockers found."
- Show PLAN.md summary (goal, wave count, success criteria)
- Suggest: "Run `a1-execute` to start implementation."

### If verdict is FAIL
- Inform user: "Plan has <N> blocker(s):"
- List each BLOCKER finding in one line
- Route back to Phase 3 (revision mode)
- Maximum 2 revision cycles — if still FAIL after 2, surface to user for manual decision

### Revision limit reached
If this is the second audit and still FAIL:
```
⚠ Plan still has blockers after 2 revision cycles.

Remaining blockers:
<list>

Options:
1. I can try to fix these manually — tell me which to address
2. Proceed anyway (I'll flag these as known risks)
3. Cancel and start fresh
```
