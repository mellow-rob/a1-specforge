# Phase 4: Apply

Show each proposal in detail and apply on user confirmation.

## Per-proposal flow

For each proposal from Phase 3:

### 4a. Show full diff
Present the exact before/after change clearly.

### 4b. Ask for decision
```
Apply this change? 
[y] Apply  [n] Skip  [e] Edit first  [a] Apply all remaining
```

### 4c. Apply if confirmed
Use Edit tool to make the exact change.

### 4d. Verify change is syntactically correct
Quick read-back to confirm the edit landed cleanly.

## After all proposals processed

### Update Obsidian Vault — patterns.md (primary)
```bash
VAULT="$HOME/Documents/Obsidian Vault"
PATTERNS="$VAULT/areas/a1-learnings/patterns.md"
```

Update `patterns.md`:
1. Update frontmatter `updated:` date
2. Update "Aktive Patterns" table — add/update rows for each processed pattern
3. Append to "Changelog" table — one row per applied change with commit hash

Format for new pattern rows:
```markdown
| missing_wiring | 8 | HIGH | agents/a1-pablo-planner.md | ✅ applied 2026-05-17 |
| wave_ordering | 3 | MED | agents/a1-pablo-planner.md | ✅ applied 2026-05-17 |
| vague_action | 2 | LOW | — | 👀 monitoring |
```

Also update `index.md` — set "Last synthesis" date in the intro block.

### Update local cache
```bash
cat > ~/.claude/skills/_shared/learnings-index.md << EOF
# Learning Index (cache — canonical is Obsidian Vault areas/a1-learnings/patterns.md)

Last synthesis: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
Applied: <count> | Skipped: <count> | Monitoring: <count>
EOF
```
