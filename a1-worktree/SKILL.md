  Isolated Git worktree lifecycle: Prepare → Enter → Exit (keep/discard/handoff).
  Lets agents work on a feature branch in a parallel checkout without polluting
  the main tree. Registry at `~/.a1-worktrees-registry.json`, worktrees at
  `<repo-parent>/a1-worktrees/<slug>/`, branches default `feature/<slug>`.
  MUST trigger when the user says: "worktree für <feature>", "isolierter
  branch", "a1-worktree", "neuen worktree anlegen", "worktree aufräumen",
  "worktree exit", "worktree handoff", "worktree für PR vorbereiten",
  "experimentell entwickeln", "agent in worktree arbeiten lassen", or any
  request to spawn, manage, or tear down an isolated working copy.
  Distinct from a1-new-feature (which produces specs/plans). Hands off to
  a1-pr-review when exited with `--mode handoff`.
  Do NOT activate for: ordinary `git checkout <branch>` without parallelism,
  raw `git worktree` commands outside the registry, or PR creation
  (use a1-pr-review).

# a1-worktree — Isolated Worktree Lifecycle

This skill is a thin orchestrator. The lifecycle logic lives in `workflows/`.
The shared CLI helper (`~/.claude/skills/_shared/a1-tools.cjs worktree`)
handles all deterministic git + registry operations.

## When to use

Activate when an agent needs to work on a feature branch in isolation from
the main checkout — typical case: `a1-new-feature` finished Phase 4 (Plan)
and Phase 5 (Implement) is about to start. The implementing agent should
operate in a worktree so the user's main checkout stays untouched.

## When NOT to use

- Ordinary `git checkout <branch>` workflows where no parallelism is needed.
- PR creation, review, merge — those belong to `a1-pr-review`.
- Direct `git worktree` operations the user wants to run themselves outside
  the registry.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Workflow | Status after |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Prepare | `workflows/01-prepare.md` | prepared |
| 2 | Enter | `workflows/02-enter.md` | active |
| 3 | Exit | `workflows/03-exit.md` | cleaned (or handoff) |

## Routing — pick the right phase

1. If the user wants a new worktree → Phase 1 (Prepare).
2. If a registry entry exists with status `prepared` for the slug → Phase 2 (Enter).
3. If the user wants to wrap up an active worktree → Phase 3 (Exit).
4. If the user asks about state (`list`, `status`) → call the CLI directly,
   no phase needed.

## State mechanics

State is persisted in a user-global registry at `~/.a1-worktrees-registry.json`.
Update it via the CLI helper only — never write the file directly:

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/_shared/a1-tools.cjs worktree prepare <repo-root> <slug>
node ~/.claude/skills/_shared/a1-tools.cjs worktree enter <id>
node ~/.claude/skills/_shared/a1-tools.cjs worktree exit <id> --mode <keep|discard|handoff>
```

Registry writes are atomic (read → modify → write-tmp → rename).

## Storage

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| Worktrees | `<repo-parent>/a1-worktrees/<slug>/` |
| Registry | `~/.a1-worktrees-registry.json` (user-global) |

Override registry location via `A1_WORKTREE_REGISTRY` env var (used in tests).

## Exit modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `keep` | Worktree removed, branch kept. Use when feature continues on `main` checkout. |
| `discard` | Worktree removed, branch deleted. Only allowed if branch has no unmerged commits. Otherwise CLI refuses. |
| `handoff` | Worktree stays, registry status set to `handoff`. Signals to `a1-pr-review` that the branch is ready for PR review. |

## Agent integration

None. This skill is pure lifecycle management. Other skills (notably
`a1-new-feature` Phase 5) call into it.

## Hard rules

- Never run `git worktree add/remove` or `git branch -D` outside the CLI.
  The registry must stay in sync.
- Never modify `~/.a1-worktrees-registry.json` directly with Edit/Write.
- Pre-Flight checks are mandatory before `enter` — never skip Prepare.
- User must confirm before any destructive action (`exit --mode discard`,
  any branch deletion, force-remove of a dirty worktree).
- User-facing prompts and messages are in **German**. CLI output (JSON, log
  lines) stays in English.
- One worktree per `<repo-root, slug>` tuple. If a registry entry already
  exists for that pair, `prepare` refuses unless `--force-reset` is given.

## Hand-offs

- Prepare PASS → user proceeds to Enter (or this skill chains directly into
  Phase 2).
- Enter complete → worktree path is returned to the caller (usually the user
  or another skill). The implementing agent then operates inside that path.
- Exit `handoff` → `a1-pr-review` takes over. The registry entry remains
  with status `handoff` until that skill clears it.
- Exit `keep` / `discard` → terminal. Registry entry status `cleaned`.
