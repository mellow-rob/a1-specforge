description: >
  Create and manage project roadmaps — break a product vision into milestones,
  phases, and a scaffolded .a1/ directory ready for a1-plan. Four phases:
  Discover (interview vision) → Research (a1-rico-researcher domain scan) →
  Structure (milestones + phases breakdown) → Scaffold (write .a1/roadmap.md +
  per-phase GOAL.md). Two modes: new-project (full flow) and new-milestone
  (abbreviated, skips research if stack unchanged). MUST trigger when the
  user says: "neues projekt", "new project", "roadmap erstellen", "a1-roadmap",
  "milestones planen", "projekt aufsetzen", "project setup", "meilensteine",
  "milestone plan erstellen", "neue milestone", "new milestone", "projekt von
  null aufsetzen", "wie strukturieren wir das projekt", "plan the project from
  scratch", "break this product into milestones", or any request to plan a
  project from scratch or add a new milestone to an existing project. Hands
  off to a1-plan once the first phase is scaffolded. Do NOT activate for:
  planning a single phase that already exists (use a1-plan), checking project
  status (use a1-progress), feature ideas without a project (use
  a1-new-feature), or constitution/rules (use a1-constitution).

# a1-roadmap — Project & Milestone Planning

Thin orchestrator. Phase logic in `workflows/`. a1-rico-researcher does domain research.

## When to use

Activate when the user wants to:
- Start a **new project** and plan its milestones and phases
- Add a **new milestone** to an existing project
- Get a **structured breakdown** of a product vision into executable phases

**Output:** `roadmap.md` in `.a1/` + phase directories scaffolded and ready for `a1-plan`.

## Modes

### New Project
Full flow: Discover → Research → Structure → Scaffold

### New Milestone
Abbreviated flow: Understand → Structure → Scaffold (skip full research if project already exists)

## Phases

| # | Phase | Workflow | Agent | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Discover | `workflows/01-discover.md` | — (conversation) | Vision doc |
| 2 | Research | `workflows/02-research.md` | a1-rico-researcher | RESEARCH.md |
| 3 | Structure | `workflows/03-structure.md` | — (orchestrator) | Milestone/phase breakdown |
| 4 | Scaffold | `workflows/04-scaffold.md` | — (orchestrator) | .a1/ structure + roadmap.md |

## Storage

```
.a1/
├── roadmap.md              ← milestone/phase overview
└── phases/                 ← one directory per phase (empty until a1-plan runs)
    ├── M1-P1-<name>/
    ├── M1-P2-<name>/
    └── M2-P1-<name>/
```

## Roadmap format

```markdown
---
project: <name>
created: <date>
---

# Roadmap: <project name>

## Vision
<one paragraph>

## Milestone 1: <name>
**Goal:** <one sentence>  
**Success:** <measurable outcome>

### Phase M1-P1: <name>
**Goal:** <one sentence>
**Scope:** <2-3 bullet points>
**Status:** planned

### Phase M1-P2: <name>
[...]

## Milestone 2: <name>
[...]
```

## Hard rules

- Always confirm the milestone/phase breakdown with the user before scaffolding
- Phase names are in format `M<N>-P<N>-<kebab-name>` (e.g., `M1-P1-auth-setup`)
- Never scaffold more than one milestone ahead (avoids over-engineering)
- If project has existing `.a1/`, add new milestone without touching existing phase dirs
