# a1 Learning Schema

Shared format for all observation and learning data across the a1 skill set.

## observations.jsonl (per phase, written by agents during execution)

One JSON object per line. Written to `.a1/phases/<name>/observations.jsonl`.

```jsonl
{"ts":"2026-05-17T15:00:00Z","agent":"a1-erik-executor","skill":"a1-execute","phase":"M1-P2-auth","wave":2,"type":"deviation","severity":"minor","msg":"Had to add missing import in 3 files — not in plan","pattern":"missing_import"}
{"ts":"...","agent":"a1-erik-executor","skill":"a1-execute","phase":"M1-P2-auth","wave":3,"type":"blocker","severity":"major","msg":"Router wiring not in plan — had to add manually","pattern":"missing_wiring"}
{"ts":"...","agent":"a1-victor-verifier","skill":"a1-execute","phase":"M1-P2-auth","wave":null,"type":"gap","severity":"major","msg":"SC-2 endpoint existed but not registered in router","pattern":"wiring_gap"}

```

### Observation types
- `deviation` — executor had to do work outside the plan
- `blocker` — task couldn't complete without unplanned work
- `gap` — verifier found something missing or not wired
- `plan_quality` — plan structure issue (wave ordering, ambiguous task, vague done-when)
- `research_miss` — something research should have caught but didn't
- `timing` — task took significantly more/less effort than expected

### Severity
- `minor` — resolved inline, no execution impact
- `major` — caused rework or partial completion
- `critical` — caused wave to block

### Pattern field (standardized tags — use these for clustering)
`missing_import` | `missing_wiring` | `wiring_gap` | `wave_ordering` | `vague_action` | `missing_migration` | `env_var_undocumented` | `test_gap` | `scope_creep` | `research_stale` | `router_not_updated` | `type_error_cascade`

## _learning.md (per skill, accumulated across all runs)

Lives at `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/_learning.md`.

Append-only. One entry per execution run.

```markdown
## 2026-05-17 — n3ural-platform / M1-P2-auth

**Skill:** a1-execute  
**Outcome:** PARTIAL (1 gap — SC-2 not wired)  
**Project type:** Next.js + Postgres  

### Observations (from agents)
- [executor/W2/major] Router wiring not in plan — added manually (pattern: missing_wiring)
- [executor/W1/minor] 3 missing imports — added inline (pattern: missing_import)
- [verifier/gap/major] SC-2: endpoint existed but not registered (pattern: wiring_gap)

### Retro
✅ a1-rico-researcher caught JWT version mismatch before it caused issues  
✅ Wave 1 ran cleanly — foundation tasks well-scoped  
⚠️ a1-pablo-planner consistently misses router registration as an explicit task  
⚠️ "Done when" on Task 2.3 was too vague — executor interpreted it differently  

### Suggested improvement
a1-pablo-planner should add "wire to router/index" as a standard Wave 3 task for API phases.
